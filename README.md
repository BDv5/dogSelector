<h2>How It's Made:</h2>

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

A team of five software engineers from the 100devs agency met on remo.co and came up with an idea to make a full stack application for selecting a dog breed based on compatibility. We decided to use replit.com to code livestream. The work was split among the engineers to work on HTML, CSS, JS and the Server (Node.js). We could see the changes instantly, debug, make suggestions and add comments. Once we developed the main features, then we moved the project to GitHub, made forks and continued to work on the project and collaborate.

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>

When using online editors, we found there are some limitations when using Node.js packages. We downloaded the project locally and debugged using Visual Studio Code to confirm that the application will run locally. We deployed the dog selector application to Heroku to test the functionality and found that it worked as intended.
